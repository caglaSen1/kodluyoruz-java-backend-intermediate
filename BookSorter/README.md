# Book Sorter


- Design a class called Book. 
- Inherit this class from the Comparable interface and override the "compareTo" method. 
- In this method, write the code that sorts the book from A to Z by name. 
- Create 5 objects of this class and store them in a structure of type Set. 
- Then use a second data structure of type Set and make it sort the books by the number of pages.



Book class consists of book name, number of pages, author's name, publication date variables.
